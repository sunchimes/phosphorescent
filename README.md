## ðŸ”† Setup

1. Clone repo with submodules
`$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:sunchimes/phosphorescent.git`

2. Build libraries and compile source
`$ ./build.sh`

3. Optional: Update submodules if out of date
`$ git submodule update --init --recursive`


## ðŸ”† Develop

1. From the working directory:
`$ cd src/arp/`

2. Reset the Daisy: on the Daisy Seed, hold down BOOT and then press RESET. 

3. Build the program and flash it onto the Daisy Seed:
`$ make clean; make; make program-dfu`


## ðŸ”† Updating the Submodules

To pull everything for the repo and submodules:
`$ git pull --recurse-submodules`

To only pull changes for the submodules:
`$ git submodule update --remote`

Whenever there are changes to the libraries (whether from pulling from git or manually editing the libraries) they will need to be rebuilt. This can be done by either running `./ci/build_libs.sh` or entering the directory of the library with changes and running `make`.
